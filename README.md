  # Cathedral: Epistemic Integration Engine

  An integrated ecosystem for cell biology understanding that bridges
  empirical observation with epistemic reasoning. Addresses fundamental
  questions about life through systematic integration of microscopy,
  biochemistry, and molecular biology data.

  ## Core Concept

  Cathedral transforms biological data accumulation into genuine
  understanding by connecting cellular observations to life principles
  through rigorous epistemic reasoning. The system integrates multiple
  experimental modalities to reason about biological meaning at higher
  levels.

  ## System Components

  - **Cathedral**: Epistemic integration and meta-biological reasoning
  - **Brushstrokes**: Universal perception language for microscopy
  - **Anton**: Biological interpretation engine
  - **AutoTC**: Sample biography and experimental context tracking
  - **Deepthought**: Autonomous experimental control

  ## Key Features

  - Multi-modal experimental data integration
  - Cross-scale reasoning (molecular to cellular to organismal)
  - Hypothesis-driven meta-analysis
  - Temporal integration across different time scales
  - "What is life?" question framework testing
